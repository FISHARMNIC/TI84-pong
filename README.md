# TI84-pong
## Rudimentary pong game built in C for he Ti-84plus CE calculator!
---
Made using the [CE C Toolchain](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html)  
Note, a "jailbreak" such as [Artifice](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/) is required to run the binaries  
Also, the source code is a bit messy. I wrote this a while ago back when I was first learning C
